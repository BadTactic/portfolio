  <p>
    Here is brief overview of the work that I have been attempting to accomplish through my education here at Epicodus.
    Unfortunately, much to my dismay, the amount of time that I can spend on weekly basis that is dedicated to studies is extremely limited.
    Therefore this project, and the body of my work thus far, is very <strong>very</strong> basic.

  <h3>About Myself</h3>
  <img class="img-responsive" src="images/face.jpg" alt="A picture of my face." />
  <p>
    I am a strategic sourcing, talent qualification and deployment professional living in the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon. My focus is largely serving the major creative organizations in the PACNW and their respective organizational initiatives, whether those be technical in nature e.g. SDLC initiatives, migrations, implementations, infrastructure overhauls, Big Data initiatives, data modeling/visualization projects, front-end development projects, creative initiatives etc. or Functional projects; such as business process engineering projects, project management operations, business analysis/business systems analysis needs, marketing strategy overhauls etc.
    Whatever the request, I seek the finest talent with the best cultural fit for the project. I am continuously seeking the next double coincidence of wants.
    My primary interests are in entrepreneurship, recruitment, photography, business organization & foundation, evolutionary psychology and ultimately working with people.
    <div class="emphasized">
      I aspire to building excellent relationships, solving problems and infiltrating/understanding complex systems. Networks are my passion, people are my bailiwick, and relationships are at the bedrock of both.
